When a mutation occurs in a critical gene involved in cell growth and division, it can disrupt the normal regulation of these processes, leading to altered cell growth patterns and increased risk of cancer.\nTo understand how mutations affect cell growth in metazoans, let's consider the role of key genes and signaling pathways involved in normal cell growth and division. For example, tumor protein p53 is a critical gene that regulates cell growth and division, and mutations in this gene are a common cause of cancer. Similarly, mutations in genes involved in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, such as cytochrome c oxidase, can also lead to altered cell growth and increased cancer risk.\nIn addition to directly disrupt", "metadata": {"model": "llama"}}
