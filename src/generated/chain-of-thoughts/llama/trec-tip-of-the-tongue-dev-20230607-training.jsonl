He had a sidekick who was actually human but I can’t remember what his job was.  As I recall they were investigating something.  What I remember the most is that the computer guy had an extremely fast car, so fast that you could barely see it when he drove it.  So his sidekick at one point remarked that he was driving dangerously fast, to which the computer guy replied that it was all good because his reflexes were so fast.  To which his sidekick  replied “Maybe you have good reflexes, but all the other drivers are human and don’t have those reflexes” and the computer guy agreed and slowed down.

I am not sure about its age even back then but it was a color movie though. There was a sentient ship computer (or core) of a crashed/landed alien ship resembling a big emerald. There was a group of bad guys (the boss was a europan dude) who took it from the ship for some surely bad purpose. Then there was this group of young asian people trying to help it get back to the ship, but not before they had some fun with it. I remember the computer could alter reality for you when you were close enough to it – like this one time when one of the boys was voyeuring a girlfriend behind a window and asking the computer to make her strip down. It granted him the wish but in the end it appeared as if she was peeling away her skin to reveal a lizard one underneath, the dude was shocked and fell of a window. Then I remember the final fighting scene taking place in some ancient ruins where the ship was hidden and the evil boss using two sais (ninja weapons resembling small tridents).  The computer “died” in the end, but not before “giving birth” to its smaller successor. I tried to find it using google, searched a number of databases with sci-fi movies from 1960s-1990s with no success.

The rose then divides in two and adorns their graves, symbolizing the end of their conflict.\nRationale:\nThe film's use of stop-motion animation, particularly in the final scene, suggests a surrealist influence, potentially nodding to the works of artists like Tim Burton or nightmare fuel.

(That’s not an accurate count.) well he does it, surprises her with flowers, I think some breakfast and tries to take her out to dinner. By the end of the movie, he wins his wife and conquers his problem. At the end of the movie his father tells him that him and his mom had gone through the same thing, one lost love for the other and the other fought for the love back.

Here's my answer in 100 words or less:\nTo prove the innocence of the accused man, Alex remains virtually trapped in his mind and interacts with him through glitches. By asking the man for help, Alex can fix the machine and retrieve his physical body from the coma. Since Alex can now interact with the man within the memory, he can prove the man's innocence by showing that the memories are falsified or altered. By fixing the machine and escaping the man's mind, Alex can clear the accused man's name and exonerate him from the crime.", "metadata": {"model": "llama"}}

The opening scene of the movie shows a male protagonist being interrupted by his mother while pleasure himself in the shower, indicating that the film may explore themes of sexuality, family dynamics, and repression. The subsequent memories of incestuous relations between siblings and a young girl with an older man also suggest a dark and unconventional storyline. The final memory of a character turning into a lizard or alien at the end of the movie further heightens the sense of confusion and unease.

Just giving context ? this was about 10-13 years ago. This channel could only afford older movies but it was in color and english if it helps. So one night I fall asleep and wake up in the middle of the night to catch the middle-to-end of a horror movie. I can’t remember exactly because it was a long time ago, but I can remember the ending very well because it scared the s*** out of me. So this family (father, mother, son and daughter) is running around in the woods, at night and they are screaming each others names. The son gets killed by a hook on the trees or some naked woman with a hook… maybe… The other 3 somehow make it back to the road to their car and quickly get in. The father steps on it. The mother notices that the son is missing so she wants to get out of the car to search for him. The father refuses to stop. The mother then starts saying she saw her mother (the grandma who wasn’t in the movie). She starts screaming again that she wants out to search for her son and mother but the father and daughter start doubting the mothers sanity. She then sits quietly and suddenly jumps out of the car. Now they might have stopped right then or the daughter had to convince the father to go back I can’t remember but she cracked her head and was dead. They put her on the back seat and drive on and keep passing by the same cabin. Here’s some conversation they had: Daughter: “We’ve been passing by that cabin all night” Father: “This is a military road, all the cabins look the same” *some arguing and desperation* Father: “If we keep driving we should be OK” *of course they run out of gas* They keep talking, they get out and try to look around. The camera switches to the mother, she opens her eyes. When the father and daughter come back shes gone. They argue that she was surely dead or now is if she ran into the woods. Now the ending… The father somehow disappeared, can’t remember how, and the daughter starts running. A black car, could have been a Black Volga, is chasing her. She trips, the car stops with the high beams right in her face *tension* the car backs off and as the lights start disappearing she wakes up in a hospital bed surrounded by people, might have been her family, I can’t remember.
