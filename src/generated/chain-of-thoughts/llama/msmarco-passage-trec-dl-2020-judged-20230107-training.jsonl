{"query-id": "583468", "query-text": "what carvedilol used for", "response": "Carvedilol is a medication used to treat high blood pressure, angina, and heart failure. It belongs to a class of drugs called beta blockers, which work by blocking the action of certain molecules in the body that cause blood vessels to constrict and heart rate to increase.
