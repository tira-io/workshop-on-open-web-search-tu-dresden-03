The basic principle is to use refrigerant that flows in a loop: first, it absorbs heat from the air outside and then transfers it to the water inside, where it can be used to heat a building through a radiator or a heat exchanger. To maximize efficiency, the heat pump is designed to operate in a reversal mode, where it can also provide cooling by extracting heat from the building and releasing it outside. By investing in an air-water heat pump, homeowners and businesses can reduce their reliance on fossil fuels, lower their energy bills, and contribute to a more sustainable future.", "metadata": {"model": "llama"}}

Here's my response:\nHybrid solar panels are solar panel systems that combine two or more different Solar technologies, such as photovoltaic (PV), solar thermal, and energy storage. The rationale behind hybrid solar panels is to improve the efficiency and reliability of the solar system by leveraging the strengths of each technology. For example, a hybrid solar panel system might use PV panels to generate electricity during peak sunlight hours, then use energy storage to store excess energy for use during non-peak hours, or use solar thermal systems to provide heat or hot water during sunny periods. By combining these technologies, hybrid solar panels can provide a more reliable and efficient source of renewable energy compared to using a single technology.
