Beef is known for its marbling, which is the fat that is dispersed throughout the meat. This high-fat content can make it more difficult to slice the meat into thin chops without it breaking apart or becoming too tough.\nIn contrast, other cuts like pork, veal, and lamb are typically sourced from different parts of the animal and have a lower fat content.
