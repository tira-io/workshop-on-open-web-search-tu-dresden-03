A McDouble consists of two beef patties, cheese, lettuce, onions, pickles, and a sesame seed bun, served separately. In contrast, a double cheeseburger typically features two beef patties, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, and a bun, with the components combined into a single patty. The separate components of a McDouble are sealed and formed into a single breading before cooking, whereas a double cheeseburger's components are typically grilled together.
