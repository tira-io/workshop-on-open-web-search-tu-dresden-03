{"query-id": "146187", "query-text": "difference between a mcdouble and a double cheeseburger", "response": "The main difference between a McDouble and a Double Cheeseburger at McDonald's is the number of cheese slices. \n\nA McDouble consists of two beef patties, one slice of cheese, pickles, onions, ketchup, and mustard, all sandwiched between a bun. On the other hand, a Double Cheeseburger also has two beef patties but comes with two slices of cheese instead of one. \n\nThe rationale behind the difference in cheese slices is likely due to cost and pricing strategies. By offering a Double Cheeseburger with an extra slice of cheese, McDonald's can market it as a slightly more premium option compared to the McDouble, which may appeal to customers looking for a heartier or cheesier option. Additionally, the pricing of the two items may also differ slightly to reflect the additional cheese slice on the Double Cheeseburger. \n\nIn conclusion, the main difference between a McDouble and a Double Cheeseburger lies in the number of cheese slices included in the sandwich, with the Double", "metadata": {"model": "gpt"}}
