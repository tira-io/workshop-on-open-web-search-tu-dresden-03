Each page is assigned an initial PageRank value, usually set to 1/N, where N is the total number of pages in the collection.\n\n2. **Link structure**: The algorithm takes into account the link structure of the web. A page that is linked to by many other pages is considered more important than a page with fewer incoming links.

Supervised learning algorithms such as support vector machines, decision trees, and neural networks have been successfully applied to NLP tasks with high accuracy.\n\nOn the other hand, unsupervised learning does not rely on labeled data and instead seeks to find patterns and relationships in the data without explicit guidance. While unsupervised learning algorithms like clustering and topic modeling can be useful for tasks such as text summarization and document clustering, they may not always perform as well as supervised learning algorithms", "metadata": {"model": "gpt"}}
