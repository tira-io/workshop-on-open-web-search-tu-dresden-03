This ensures that the employee is paying their fair share of taxes on the income they receive, even if it is in the form of a reimbursement for work-related expenses.\n\nIn summary, taxable kilometric expenses are considered income because they are a form of compensation for the employee's use of their personal vehicle for work purposes.
