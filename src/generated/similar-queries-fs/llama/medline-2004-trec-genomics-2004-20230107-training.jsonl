Ubiquitin modification involves the covalent attachment of multiple ubiquitin molecules to a target protein, which serves as a recognition signal for the proteasome, a large protein complex responsible for degredation of proteins in the cell. Ubiquitin modification can affect the function, localization, or stability of the modified protein, and plays a key role in regulating various cellular processes such as signaling pathways, gene expression, and cell cycle progression.", "metadata": {"model": "llama"}}
