Capacity: Magnetic film memory systems have a comparatively low storage capacity compared to other non-volatile memory types. The capacity of magnetic film memory systems is typically measured in kilobytes (KB) or megabytes (MB). For example, a typical magnetic film memory system may have a capacity of 10 KB to 100 MB.\n2. Data Transfer Rate: The data transfer rate of magnetic film memory systems is relatively slow compared to other memory types, typically ranging from several hundred kilohertz to a few megahertz.
