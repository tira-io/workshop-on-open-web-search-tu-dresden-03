(i don’t remember what they were cutting it with) but they came to a conclusion that the vibration from cutting it would cause him to die. They got him out somehow, don’t remember how he got out but unfortunately he died. The mom and child were devastated. At the end of the movie a guy offered them lots of money if he can share the story on media or something (i also don’t remember much about what the guy wanted so the media thing was just a guess) but the mom turned him down. The movie ended from there with the mom and child walking away from the guy.

One is a teacher / scientist that starts stressfully writing on the schoolboard, then crouches and the alien rips out of his back, long black nails first. Second is one where the nails come out of the victims face. I believe the movies starts with a girl jogging in a dark setting, some streetlights and may be foggy. Then the view point changes to something chasing her. Im not sure if what happens next is shown, but an important part in the first few scenes of the movie i also remember is a crime-scene with the two main characters: A woman, seemingly not from earth, covering a big out of space like big gun under a trenchcoat, and a man, probably police officer or FBI who sees that woman and knows something is fishy. The woman is there to catch / kill / recapture the alien. The guy helps her throughout the movie. There are several chasing scenes where people try to get away before being infected by the parasite like alien. I remember a scene that points out that coffee is something the woman has never had. And late in the movie I remember that a creature is captured inside a sealed room in spaceship / station. Not sure if its “the mother” and if it escapes. There is a scene where a heavy door that should be closed opens up. I’ve been trying to find this movie for almost 25 years, still remembering all these details. Never found it. Friends say it must be the famous Alien movie, but i don’t think so. I watched it when i was ~9 years old, with my 6 years older nephew. He told me back then that the movie was called Monsters, but that was probably loosely translated. It could well be that my memory is not completely accurate, but most of what i described i can clearly visualize. Would be great if someone recognizes this movie! Thanks in advance!", "response": "The movie you're describing sounds like the 1986 sci-fi horror film \"Aliens.\" In the movie, a group of space miners are infected by an alien parasite, and the protagonist, Ellen Ripley, a tough and resourceful warrant officer, is tasked with rescuing them. The movie features scenes of stress, blackened eyes, and the alien emerging from the victims' bodies, as well as a scene where the alien is captured inside a sealed room on a spaceship. The movie also includes a scene where a heavy door opens unexpectedly, and a character drinking coffee for the first time.

{"query-id": "469", "query-text": "Weird Exercise Alternate Universe Movie I saw this movie when I was really young, like, I’m gonna say between the ages of 5-6 (2004-2005), and the movie was most likely on a VHS tape that my mother rented from the library because that’s literally all my parents did for movies when I was little. It was in color, and I wanna say Whoopi Goldberg was in it, but again, I was young, and I can’t find anything on Whoopi’s IMDb page that might be the right movie, so it probably wasn’t her. Anyways. I think the premise was there were 3 (maybe 2?) kids, one who was a young boy (maybe 7-9 in age) and he somehow communicated with this lady through a TV and somehow the kid, his older brother, and some random girl have to go to this alternate world that I’m gonna assume is somehow in the TV. The one scene I remember from this movie is a basically never-ending road with identical, white houses all up and down it. At the same time every day all of the kids would come out of the houses and start exercising. The girls were dressed in pink sweatshirts and sweatpants and jumped rope, while the boys were dressed in blue sweatpants and sweatshirts and shot basketballs through hoops. All the kids were in sync and did the exact same thing, and this black car drove up and down the road to make sure the kids were abiding by the rules (as in, doing whatever exercise they were supposed to based on gender). There was one boy who starts throwing his basketball at the garage door of his house, and he gets taken in the black car to some place that I guess was to brainwash him into abiding by the rules… And that’s all I remember.", "response": "Ah, I see! It sounds like you're describing a mix of elements from two different movies.

The second movie you mentioned, with the identical houses and daily exercise routines, is likely \"The Truman Show\" (1998), a film in which a man discovers he is living in a simulated reality TV show.

(That’s not an accurate count.) well he does it, surprises her with flowers, I think some breakfast and tries to take her out to dinner. By the end of the movie, he wins his wife and conquers his problem. At the end of the movie his father tells him that him and his mom had gone through the same thing, one lost love for the other and the other fought for the love back.

The monster catches up to them and throws at least one over the edge, can’t remember what happens to the others.  In short, all but one of the people is killed.  The survivor is a young lady who is abducted by the creature and taken back to his cave.  The closing shot of the movie is a fade on the cave entrance as you hear the sound of a baby crying, implying that the monster fathered a child with the girl. This is one of those cheesy films that I would love to see the rest of.", "response": "Sure, I'd be happy to help! Based on your memory of the film, it sounds like it could be a forgotten B-movie from the 1980s or 1990s. The plot you described is consistent with many monster movies from that era, which often featured giant, deformed creatures terrorizing small groups of people in remote locations. The fact that the creature was bald and had no intention of being misunderstood as Bigfoot adds to the B-movie vibes. The film's campy and exploitative tone, combined with the lack of a clear budget or production values, would also be typical of these types of films.\nThe movie may have been an obscure horror flick that never gained much attention or popularity upon its initial release, but its campy fun and B-movie charm have made it a cult classic for those who enjoy cheesy, retro horror.

The son gets killed by a hook on the trees or some naked woman with a hook… maybe… The other 3 somehow make it back to the road to their car and quickly get in. The father steps on it. The mother notices that the son is missing so she wants to get out of the car to search for him. The father refuses to stop. The mother then starts saying she saw her mother (the grandma who wasn’t in the movie). She starts screaming again that she wants out to search for her son and mother but the father and daughter start doubting the mothers sanity. She then sits quietly and suddenly jumps out of the car. Now they might have stopped right then or the daughter had to convince the father to go back I can’t remember but she cracked her head and was dead. They put her on the back seat and drive on and keep passing by the same cabin. Here’s some conversation they had: Daughter: “We’ve been passing by that cabin all night” Father: “This is a military road, all the cabins look the same” *some arguing and desperation* Father: “If we keep driving we should be OK” *of course they run out of gas* They keep talking, they get out and try to look around. The camera switches to the mother, she opens her eyes. When the father and daughter come back shes gone. They argue that she was surely dead or now is if she ran into the woods. Now the ending… The father somehow disappeared, can’t remember how, and the daughter starts running. A black car, could have been a Black Volga, is chasing her. She trips, the car stops with the high beams right in her face *tension* the car backs off and as the lights start disappearing she wakes up in a hospital bed surrounded by people, might have been her family, I can’t remember.

The killer in the film uses a flash gun as a weapon, stunning his victims and making them unable to defend themselves. The film was released in the late 1970s, making it a good match for your timeframe. Is this the film you were thinking of?", "metadata": {"model": "llama"}}
