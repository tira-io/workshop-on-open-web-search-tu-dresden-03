I am not sure about its age even back then but it was a color movie though. There was a sentient ship computer (or core) of a crashed/landed alien ship resembling a big emerald. There was a group of bad guys (the boss was a europan dude) who took it from the ship for some surely bad purpose. Then there was this group of young asian people trying to help it get back to the ship, but not before they had some fun with it. I remember the computer could alter reality for you when you were close enough to it – like this one time when one of the boys was voyeuring a girlfriend behind a window and asking the computer to make her strip down. It granted him the wish but in the end it appeared as if she was peeling away her skin to reveal a lizard one underneath, the dude was shocked and fell of a window. Then I remember the final fighting scene taking place in some ancient ruins where the ship was hidden and the evil boss using two sais (ninja weapons resembling small tridents).  The computer “died” in the end, but not before “giving birth” to its smaller successor. I tried to find it using google, searched a number of databases with sci-fi movies from 1960s-1990s with no success.

I saw this movie sometime around 2011-2014, someone borrowed it from a Redbox, so I would think the movie came out sometime around then. It is set in a fantasy medieval-ish kingdom. Starts of with a man being a guard, or something similar, to a king and somehow a king became a tyrant (or the king died and his son became the tyrant king?). Some people were killed (tried to run and were killed?) including this man’s family. I think this happened during the winter (unless the kingdom was always cold.) Man pretends to be a drunkard who has lost hope and goes home with a prostitute every night, but really isn’t a drunkard and pays the prostitute without actually spending any time with her and goes home, as he is only putting on an act so the king’s men will think he has given up and is not plotting revenge (but he is).  This man along with some other guys are all in on a plan to overthrow the king. Their job is to make shields and somehow use the rivets in the shield (they looked like viking shields with the rivets around the edges, if I remember correctly) as part of their plan, or messaging system to plan the plan. Something of that sort. At some point a man on the inside, as they say, has a daughter that is going to be forced to marry the king, but they smuggle the main character guy inside the castle in an ornate mirror so that he can rescue their inside man’s daughter. I’m quite sure near the end, or at the end of the movie, the group battle the king’s men outside the castle, defeats them, and it show’s the main guy ready to go into the castle to kill the king.

So pretty much this is a love story of complications between this married couple, the husband is the one messing up and the wife is the one who keeps putting up with it. He has an addiction to porn, the wife finds out and I think it really upset her. So the husband goes to his dad for advice, to figure how to fight for someone who doesn’t love you anymore. The dad and mom are very Christian. The dad gives his son the idea of a book of I think 100 things to try and by the end of the book, he should win his wife’s love back. (That’s not an accurate count.) well he does it, surprises her with flowers, I think some breakfast and tries to take her out to dinner. By the end of the movie, he wins his wife and conquers his problem. At the end of the movie his father tells him that him and his mom had gone through the same thing, one lost love for the other and the other fought for the love back. The plot twist was that, even though the father was giving his son the advice he needed as if he had done the same thing, he actually tells his son that [he] had been the one to lose love for his mother and his mother was the one who had fought to get it back. Then the son goes back into his house where his mother and wife were, crying and apologized and hugged his mom. I believe it was because he had been avoiding her and didn’t want anything to do with her assuming that she had put his through what he had gone. But that might not be correct.

{"query-id": "723", "query-text": "Scary car that scared my childhood *not a native english speaker so bear with me* When I was a kid I lived in a small village and we had 2-3 channels on the TV. We would fall asleep watching the TV. Usually I was the last one to fall asleep and so could watch part of a horror movie until commercials came on and I fell asleep from boredom and the TV would run until morning, or I woke up later and caught the ending and turned off the TV. Just giving context ? this was about 10-13 years ago. This channel could only afford older movies but it was in color and english if it helps. So one night I fall asleep and wake up in the middle of the night to catch the middle-to-end of a horror movie. I can’t remember exactly because it was a long time ago, but I can remember the ending very well because it scared the s*** out of me. So this family (father, mother, son and daughter) is running around in the woods, at night and they are screaming each others names. The son gets killed by a hook on the trees or some naked woman with a hook… maybe… The other 3 somehow make it back to the road to their car and quickly get in. The father steps on it. The mother notices that the son is missing so she wants to get out of the car to search for him. The father refuses to stop. The mother then starts saying she saw her mother (the grandma who wasn’t in the movie). She starts screaming again that she wants out to search for her son and mother but the father and daughter start doubting the mothers sanity. She then sits quietly and suddenly jumps out of the car. Now they might have stopped right then or the daughter had to convince the father to go back I can’t remember but she cracked her head and was dead. They put her on the back seat and drive on and keep passing by the same cabin. Here’s some conversation they had: Daughter: “We’ve been passing by that cabin all night” Father: “This is a military road, all the cabins look the same” *some arguing and desperation* Father: “If we keep driving we should be OK” *of course they run out of gas* They keep talking, they get out and try to look around. The camera switches to the mother, she opens her eyes. When the father and daughter come back shes gone. They argue that she was surely dead or now is if she ran into the woods. Now the ending… The father somehow disappeared, can’t remember how, and the daughter starts running. A black car, could have been a Black Volga, is chasing her. She trips, the car stops with the high beams right in her face *tension* the car backs off and as the lights start disappearing she wakes up in a hospital bed surrounded by people, might have been her family, I can’t remember.

There was a movie I saw on tv sometime in the mid to late ’90s (don’t know when it was made or whether or not it was made for tv). I think I remember a young girl who was tied to a tree in the woods. There was a blonde woman who said something about blood and Satan. There may have been a telepathic connection between her and the girl. Maybe the woman was trying to find her. There may have also been a witch, but maybe not. I don’t even know how accurate any of these memories are, but I figure it’s worth a shot since it’s been bugging me for a long time. It was in English and in color.", "response": "1. Horror movie with a young girl tied up in the woods and a blonde woman talking about blood and Satan.\n2.
