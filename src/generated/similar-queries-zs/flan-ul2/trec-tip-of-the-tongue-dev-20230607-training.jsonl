The resident of the apartment is a man who wears a mask and gloves, never taking them off. He makes her breakfast. The apartment is full of art and statues and books, almost museum-like. There’s some fancy mirror somewhere and a scene takes place there. The woman at some point is in a cell where she is tortured every day. The only thing keeping her going is a letter she finds hidden in the wall that’s a first hand account of a previous woman being tortured there. When she escapes she realizes the person holding her captive and torturing her was the masked/gloved man. She’s furious and I think leaves. At some point it becomes known that the masked/gloved man was one of the people experimented on by the Angel of Death (Mengele), a nazi doctor who did experiments on twins, handicapped, elderly. The man was referred to as his cell number, and because of the experiments he developed super immunity to either disease (I think). There was a fire at the place where Mengele did the experiments and the man survived but had burns all over his body hence the mask and gloves. At some point the woman comes back. The police I think are after the masked man. I’m not sure if he gets shot, but they’re in the metro station and at some point the woman puts him (I think he was dying?) on a metro car full of flowers and bombs and sends it off to blow up.

Also not sure if that was death in general, or just death by foot-worm). 3. There were doctors who would operate on people with “magic” gloves that would allow them to reach into people’s bodies without making incisions – there was some sort of training involved, and one of the main characters failed to save someone’s life because he couldn’t get the gloves to penetrate the patient’s skin. 4. It was set in a Victorian-esque setting, with horse drawn carriages 5. There was a firm divide between an area of permanent darkness and an area of light (can’t remember if the light area ever experienced night, but the dark one would never get day) 6. There was a scene where a king (or some such prominent royalty/courtier) was assassinated by having one of the aforementioned worms inserted into his food while he was sleeping (incidentally, this is the reason I cannot to this day sleep without my feet covered.

Citizens wore blue jumpsuits and acted violently for whatever reason.

It is a movie and I’m pretty sure I seen it in around 2010-2013 but I’m not sure. So pretty much this is a love story of complications between this married couple, the husband is the one messing up and the wife is the one who keeps putting up with it. He has an addiction to porn, the wife finds out and I think it really upset her. So the husband goes to his dad for advice, to figure how to fight for someone who doesn’t love you anymore. The dad and mom are very Christian. The dad gives his son the idea of a book of I think 100 things to try and by the end of the book, he should win his wife’s love back. (That’s not an accurate count.) well he does it, surprises her with flowers, I think some breakfast and tries to take her out to dinner. By the end of the movie, he wins his wife and conquers his problem. At the end of the movie his father tells him that him and his mom had gone through the same thing, one lost love for the other and the other fought for the love back. The plot twist was that, even though the father was giving his son the advice he needed as if he had done the same thing, he actually tells his son that [he] had been the one to lose love for his mother and his mother was the one who had fought to get it back. Then the son goes back into his house where his mother and wife were, crying and apologized and hugged his mom. I believe it was because he had been avoiding her and didn’t want anything to do with her assuming that she had put his through what he had gone. But that might not be correct.

{"query-id": "926", "query-text": "asian film where a man makes other people kill, and then the people forget why I rented this film in the early 2000’s.  It was in color, and may have been a Japanese film, but I can’t be sure.  The plot involves a series of murders, where the “killer” mysteriously gets other people to kill.  After the killings, this man disappears, and the people cannot remember why they killed who they did.  The first murder is a regular customer killing a prostitute.  When the police show up, the man is distraught because he has no memory of the murder. Before the second murder, a man meets the killer on a beach.  The killer says he is lost, I think, and so the man takes the killer home with him.  The man’s wife is asleep upstairs while the two of them engage in a strange conversation.  I think the killer mentions the color of the man’s wife’s niughtgown.  The man kills his wife, and then tries to kill himself when he realizes what he has done.  He first tries to kill himself by throwing himself out a window.  he then tries to kill himself in the police station by running head-first into a wall.  The cop chasing the killer has a sick wife, and eventually catches up to him.  However, I think the killer ends up escaping.", "response": ["What is the name of the movie about the man who slits his wife's throat?"], "metadata": {"model": "flan-ul2"}}

{"query-id": "723", "query-text": "Scary car that scared my childhood *not a native english speaker so bear with me* When I was a kid I lived in a small village and we had 2-3 channels on the TV. We would fall asleep watching the TV. Usually I was the last one to fall asleep and so could watch part of a horror movie until commercials came on and I fell asleep from boredom and the TV would run until morning, or I woke up later and caught the ending and turned off the TV. Just giving context ? this was about 10-13 years ago. This channel could only afford older movies but it was in color and english if it helps. So one night I fall asleep and wake up in the middle of the night to catch the middle-to-end of a horror movie. I can’t remember exactly because it was a long time ago, but I can remember the ending very well because it scared the s*** out of me. So this family (father, mother, son and daughter) is running around in the woods, at night and they are screaming each others names. The son gets killed by a hook on the trees or some naked woman with a hook… maybe… The other 3 somehow make it back to the road to their car and quickly get in. The father steps on it. The mother notices that the son is missing so she wants to get out of the car to search for him. The father refuses to stop. The mother then starts saying she saw her mother (the grandma who wasn’t in the movie). She starts screaming again that she wants out to search for her son and mother but the father and daughter start doubting the mothers sanity. She then sits quietly and suddenly jumps out of the car. Now they might have stopped right then or the daughter had to convince the father to go back I can’t remember but she cracked her head and was dead. They put her on the back seat and drive on and keep passing by the same cabin. Here’s some conversation they had: Daughter: “We’ve been passing by that cabin all night” Father: “This is a military road, all the cabins look the same” *some arguing and desperation* Father: “If we keep driving we should be OK” *of course they run out of gas* They keep talking, they get out and try to look around. The camera switches to the mother, she opens her eyes. When the father and daughter come back shes gone. They argue that she was surely dead or now is if she ran into the woods. Now the ending… The father somehow disappeared, can’t remember how, and the daughter starts running. A black car, could have been a Black Volga, is chasing her. She trips, the car stops with the high beams right in her face *tension* the car backs off and as the lights start disappearing she wakes up in a hospital bed surrounded by people, might have been her family, I can’t remember. So if it was her family maybe coma, if it wasn’t maybe she was found. Spent years trying to find the movie, if it turn out to have been a dream I’m going to feel really stupid.", "response": ["What was the name of the movie that scared me as a kid?"], "metadata": {"model": "flan-ul2"}}
